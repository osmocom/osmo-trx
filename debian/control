Description: SDR transceiver that implements Layer 1 of a GSM BTS
 OsmoTRX is a software-defined radio transceiver that implements the Layer 1
 physical layer of a BTS comprising the following 3GPP specifications:
 .
 TS 05.01 "Physical layer on the radio path"
 TS 05.02 "Multiplexing and Multiple Access on the Radio Path"
 TS 05.04 "Modulation"
 TS 05.10 "Radio subsystem synchronization"
 .
 In this context, BTS is "Base transceiver station". It's the stations that
 connect mobile phones to the mobile network.
 .
 3GPP is the "3rd Generation Partnership Project" which is the collaboration
 between different telecommunication associations for developing new
 generations of mobile phone networks. (post-2G/GSM)
